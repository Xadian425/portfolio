Description detail here: In this thrilling space game, you pilot a small but powerful ship drifting through the endless void of the cosmos. Your main goal is to survive as waves of massive asteroids hurtle toward you from all directions. Using quick reflexes and precise aim, you blast the rocks into pieces before they collide with your ship. Each impact you take drains your health, making every dodge and shot count. The deeper you venture into space, the faster and denser the asteroid fields become, testing your skill and endurance. Once your health reaches zero, your ship explodes in a flash of lightâ€”marking the end of your cosmic journey.
